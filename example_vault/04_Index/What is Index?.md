This is where I like to keep notes that link to other notes.
For example, you starting a new class and want to keep everything about the class organized in one place. You create a class index and link each chapter's note here.

This way you can include this index note into your homepage, and have it pop up every time you open obsidian. *and, of course, the homepage is dynamic so you can always keep links to everything you are working on as you need it*.

I went too overboard in the beginning with indexes, so only create as you need, not in preparation for needing. Otherwise, you will have empty notes here.

How I use tags here:
`#index/subject`
But again, you can do it however you would like to.
