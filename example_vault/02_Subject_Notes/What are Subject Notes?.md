Notes that have a substantial air to them. 

Includes: college notes, learning notes, gaming notes (stardew valley optimization routes).
Does not include: random ideas, notes that only include links (resource notes).

They have to include something written in your own words.
You can organize them into folders.

What tags I use:
`#note/subject/optional`
normally I try to keep subject as a big thing: `certification` and each certification I am currently working on as the optional. ex: `#note/certification/NetworkPlus`

However you choose is up to you, but if you would like organize your obsidian mostly through tags I would suggest you follow something like the example.
