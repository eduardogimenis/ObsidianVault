Daily notes go into here, they are sorted by date automatically. Don't create new folders here since some queries assume they aren't folder organized.

Each daily note can be clicked through the calendar plug-in as well, so it's visualized that way.
You should always use the daily template, and I would normally keep everything that is a random note, notes about the day, logs, etc...

How I use tags in daily:
[work in progress]
In the past:
I was using tags as an embracing description of my day: `#daily/worked`, `#daily/studied`
This works, but I am shifting my use of tags on daily notes to log my days per an estimate of hours spent on a task. I will expand below

New system:
I am inaugurating (so bare with me) a new way of using tags by mostly using `#tracker`:

- `#tracker/task`
	- I use together with the Tasks plug-in in order to create a task anywhere in the vault and be able to query it inside a daily note
	- should be the primary way of creating tasks
- `#tracker/habit`
	- is for tracking whether or not I have done something on the day of
	- still not working at the time of writing
	- tracks things like: flossed, smoked, etc...
- `#tracker/time/[type of event]`
	- logs an estimate of time spent on each thing
	- `#tracker/time/breakfast` Hours:: 1
		- the `Hours:: #` is essential
		- it's how I will be able to query the daily notes and be able to know how much time was spent on each thing
	- can be as wide or narrow as you want
