This is how I personally keep track of achievements, changes, and plans/goals in a periodic manner. One thing is to write them in your daily, another is to take a day (mine is monday bi-weekly) and write:
- what changed in the last two weeks
- what you want to change in the next two weeks
- what you have achieved
- what you plan on achieving

Create a template (doesn't have to be fancy) of your choice on how you would like to set up, and schedule a date periodically so that you can use this feature effectively.

What tags I use:
`#changelog` = How I plan to use, rules to myself
`#changelog/update` = each subsequent entry
