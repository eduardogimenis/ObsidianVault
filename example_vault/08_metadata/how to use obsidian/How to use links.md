Links are a way to transform obsidian from a note-taking app to your own personalized wikipedia. This is because you can create anything from indexes, to super detailed overview notes that include links to all the different, and concise, information that make up the whole.

to use it simply use a starting double `[[`, followed by the name of the file, `]]`.

you can even visually change the link by: `[[` name of file `|` display text `]]`.
