[[Important hotkeys]].

Each folder is basically a feature on it's own.
Read each folder's description: (tl:dr included after link)
- [[What is Daily]]
	- everyday workflow
	- tracking things, logging
- [[What are Subject Notes]]
	- taking notes on specific things
- [[What is Inbox]]
	- where non-organized (by folder) notes are kept
	- where resource notes; etc.. should be kept
- [[What is Index]]
	- way of linking related notes together
	- acts like a hub for notes
- [[What is Changelog]]
	- *optional*
	- a way of keeping yourself accountable and planning ahead

How to use obsidian:
- [[How to use tags]]
	- tag best practices
- [[How to use links]]
	- use it together with indexes
- [[How to use plug-ins]]
	- list of plug-ins used in this example vault

To use this vault effectively, and obsidian in general, use tags (create your system or follow me's own) and keep your workflow:
- homepage 
	- where you keep graphs and such (dataview)
		- period tracker overview
	- current project/class/book by having the index note
- daily note
	- where you log/journal your day
		- can be as narrow or as wide as you want
		- only effective if you keep 100% real to yourself. No one else besides yourself **needs** to see your vault. If you are not honest here, you are not going to know where to improve.
	- use tags and in-line/top-of-file properties so you can query your days
	- where your TO-DOs are visualized
		- you can create a to-do anywhere as long as you use the right tag (my example: `#tracker/task`)
- changelog
	- bi-weekly affair
		- can be any frequency you would like as long as it is consistent and scheduled
	- medium/long term planning
